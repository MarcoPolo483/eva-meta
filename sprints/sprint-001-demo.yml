      - Briefly explains EVA in 2–3 short bullets
      - Has links or buttons for: EVA DA, EVA Chat, EVA Orchestrator, EVA Knowledge Vault (even if they are placeholder routes).

      Ensure CONTEXT-PERSISTENCE-INVENTORY.md (wherever it currently lives) is linked from
      eva-meta/backlogs/vault.md and from eva-meta/backlog-map.md under the Knowledge Vault lane.
      The goal is to make this document an official seed source for the Vault lane.

    dependencies: []
    acceptance_criteria:
      - vault.md references the inventory document
      - backlog-map.md references the Vault context work and points to the inventory

    title: "Create EVA Knowledge Vault README"
    description: >
      Create a README under eva-meta/vault/README.md that briefly explains:
      - What the Knowledge Vault is
      - What kinds of documents live there (inventories, diagrams, decisions, context schemas)
      - How the Agile Crew and Copilot are expected to use it (read-only for now).

    acceptance_criteria:
      - eva-meta/vault/README.md exists
      - It mentions CONTEXT-PERSISTENCE-INVENTORY.md as one of the first seed docs

    title: "Scaffold demo-nightly workflow (placeholder)"
    description: >
      Ensure .github/workflows/demo-nightly.yml exists in the chosen repo (eva-orchestrator or eva-suite)
      with a minimal safe pipeline:
      - schedule + workflow_dispatch
      - checkout
      - setup Node
      - echo which sprint file it would use (eva-meta/sprints/sprint-001-demo.yml)
      - no real build or deployment yet.

    status: planned
    dependencies: []
    acceptance_criteria:
      - Workflow passes YAML validation
      - Manual workflow_dispatch run succeeds with only echo steps
